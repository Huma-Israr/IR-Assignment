#### DBWorld Email Classification
this folder contain Matlab Implementation for Email Classification (diffrentiating email into ham and spam class).Dataset is downloaded from UCI dataset corpus. the dataset contaion *.arff and *.m files. in First step this data is preprocessed and converted into .txt files. Classification is then Done on the text files using KNN,Naive Bayes and Rochhio Algorithm.

### Step to Run The Experiment

Step 1: Make the text file from .arff and .m files and write them using IR-testing.m

Step 2: Run Dictionary1.m 

step 3: Run trainProces2.m 

step 4: Run testProcess3.m

step 5: Run main_nb.m
        (can additionally run NBtrain and NBtest for understanding)
Step 6: Run main_knn.m
        (can additionally run KNNtrain and KNNtest for understanding)
step 7: Run main_Roc.m
        (can additionally run Roctrain and Roctest for understanding)
