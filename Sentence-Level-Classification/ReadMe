# IR-Assignment
Text Classification
Appling various Classifier on UCI Dataset (Sentence Classification Data Set: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentence+Classification ) Using irlib-0.1.1 .Classifying sentences from academic papers. 5 labled classes in the train set are 

  1: Paper contain past work that provides the basis for the work in the article ----------(BASE)
  2: comparison  of the past work---------------------------------------------------------(CONT) 
  3: The specific research goal of the paper----------------------------------------------(AIMX) 
  4: Authors own work (methods, results, and conclusions)---------------------------------(OWNX)
  5: Miscellaneous -----------------------------------------------------------------------(MISC)


# Applied Three Classifier   
    Rocchio 
    K-Nearest-Neighbors
    Naive Bayes 

# irlib-o.1.1
is Python Based Information Retrieval Libraray.It need to have Python installed on your computer and NLTK.
To install the package 

   1: Install Python 
   2: Install NLTK
   2: Install irlib==0.1.1 
   
# File Structure

Properly Cloned irlib Contain following main components:
   1. matrix.py
   2. metrics.py
   3. classifier.py
   4. preprocessor.py
   5. configuration.py
   6. superlist.py
   
 # How to use Code for the Dataset Classification 
 
1. Download the dataset and classifyText.py and classify.conf file. 
2. classifytext.py is program used to train and test the classifier.
 
 This program need irlib library file to be imported. before executing the classifytext program check the path for clssify.conf.it contain necessary configuration for the classfication task. changing classifer name in classify.conf file will execute diffrent classifier (e.g knn to Rocchio).you can also change other parameter in the classify.conf according to your requirment.
